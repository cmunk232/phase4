           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Throughout Phase 1, I got to introduce myself and express some of my creative tendencies. In Project Fuego, I was able to talk about my major, future plans, and previous knowledge/goals for this course. Although not completely successful, I was able to incorporate some of the knowledge I have acquired in undergrad and apply it in the Branching Webtext Design Project. Although I did struggle with creating buttons in html, I was able to display a few pictures of my interests in the New Media Webtext Experiment.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Due to the fact that I had no prior knowledge on coding before taking this class, it was helpful to work in groups in a classroom setting. Other students, some of whom are DNID or computer science majors were able to offer me guidance in order to put together each of my projects. A workshop environment was also helpful in that my peers and I were able to bounce ideas off each other.</p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">As I started to dive into coding, I had to keep in mind that one minor mistake could end in a drastic change. When coding, one character has the potential to completely change your ouput. Due to this, I had to think very carefully about placement, typos, and input. In order to get the results I wanted, I had to carefully insert my information into the code outline. </p>

        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">In order to complete Phase 1, and ultimately the whole course, I spent a lot of time watching videos and reading articles to point me in the right direction. For example, learning how to input buttons into the code was a new and confusing concept for me. In order to use the button correctly, I had to take the time to understand its function and learn where to place it within the body of the html.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Phase 1 is where we gave out first presentation on one of our projects. As a form of introduction we created Project Fuego, which included information such as our future careers, family and home, and previous knowledge on coding. By presenting to an audience, it gave us the chance to learn a bit about everyone in the classroom, as well as their goals for the semester. </p>

     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2/3 Course Goals</h3>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Throughout Phase 2/3, we incorporated a lot of our own creativity into our projects. We used photots in our photo essay that represented us or our potential projects, took videos that included B-roll, interviewed a person of our choosing, added our desired effect in Premiere Pro and created personalized characters in Adobe Character Creator.</p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">After every week of research done on our final project, we worked in groups during class to discuss the research we had found and our next steps towards our projects. We were also able to recommend ideas to our peers and share helpful insight on how to construct our final projects. Additionally, we talked about our conjectures, definitions, qualities, and policies every week.</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Completing each project in Phase 2/3 allowed for us to develop a set of skills that were useful for piecing together our final project. Each tool that we were introduced to gave new insight on how to edit our projects to our desired perfection. Whether we wanted to make a video or website of our project, we acquired and learned all tools/skills needed to do so. </p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">As I have mentioned before, each week we talked in groups about the research we had found. This research could include articles, papers, videos, or images that related to our final project. By doing this research every week, for four weeks, we acquired the information needed to develop the main idea of the final project.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">In our research groups, we presented our weekly projects to peers. While presenting, we discussed methods we used, challenges we ran into, solutions to problems, and how we could use the tools given to us to bring our visions to life. Presenting to our peers resulted in feedback, discussion, and new ideas to test our creativity. </p>

  <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">To create our final project, we had to use both the tools we were given and our creativity. Through usage of platforms, such as charactor creator or premeire pro, we were able to express our personal interests turned into a interactive display. We chose a main idea to our projects and then pieced together previous projects to make the final model.  </p>

          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">For every project completed throughout the semester, we had the chance to ask questions, work with our classmates, and discuss our creative habits. When presenting our final project, we were able to interact with and observe everyone's projects, as well as explain the main ideas behind our own projects. </p>
      </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">To successfully create our final project, we had to utilize previously learned concepts and apply them to our broader idea. While at the beginning of the semester, we learned to use one tool at a time, our final project required us to utilize multiple tools at once in order for our audience members to be able to interact.</p>

Combining this research and development of skill, we were able to craft an input and obtain the desired output. Weeks of practice allowed us to take our interests and demonstrate them to an audience.</p>
